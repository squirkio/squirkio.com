Synthy post pop banger, nice driving bass throughout with some stingy lyrics with a subject matter close to my heart - spending so much time on the internet and believing all kinds of muck and turning into a bit of a nob as a result. The analog synths sound amazing and it's a real smart mix of retro electronics paired with modern indie pop vibes.

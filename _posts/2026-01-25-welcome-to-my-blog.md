Welcome to your new Jekyll blog! This is your first post. You can edit or delete it to get started.

## How to create new posts

1. Create a new file in the `_posts` folder
2. Name it using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`
3. Add front matter at the top (the section between `---` marks)
4. Write your content in Markdown below the front matter

## Example front matter

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2026-01-25
excerpt: "A brief description of your post"
author: "Your Name"
---
```

That's it! Jekyll will automatically:
- Generate URLs based on the permalink setting in `_config.yml`
- Build your blog listing page
- Format your posts with the post layout

Happy blogging!

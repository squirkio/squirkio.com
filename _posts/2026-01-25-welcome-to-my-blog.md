Welcome travellers, real or robotic. I have it in mind to post things for me that might be useful for you too. I like reccomending things, so I just know that'll be a big part of what goes here. I will try to share what I'm learning too in case it's helpful and things I've found funny too. 

The home page has links to my socials, if you want to engage, please go there.

<!-- ## How to create new posts

1. Create a new file in the `_posts` folder
2. Name it using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`
3. Add front matter at the top (the section between `---` marks)
4. Write your content in Markdown below the front matter

## Example front matter

```yaml

layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2026-01-25
excerpt: "A brief description of your post"
author: "Your Name"
---
```

That's it! Jekyll will automatically:
- Generate URLs based on the permalink setting in `_config.yml`
- Build your blog listing page
- Format your posts with the post layout

Happy blogging! -->
